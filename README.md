# Store Sales Forecasting

This project aims to predict store sales using historical sales data. The dataset used contains sales, store features, and other relevant data that can help in building predictive models for forecasting future sales. The project also includes a Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze the data interactively.

## Description

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply machine learning models for sales forecasting. The model outputs can help businesses make data-driven decisions regarding inventory management, sales strategy, and staffing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building predictive models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive sales dashboards and reports.
- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating the database (if applicable).

###  **Installation Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Store-Sales-Forecasting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Store-Sales-Forecasting
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts as needed for analysis and modeling.

## Usage

- To run the exploratory data analysis (EDA), navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open the `EDA.ipynb` notebook.
- To train the model, execute the `train_model.py` script in the `scripts` folder.
- The Power BI dashboard can be opened by navigating to the `PowerBI` folder and opening the `.pbix` file.
